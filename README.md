Hey there! 👋

I'm diecodev, a full stack developer who loves creating fast, high-performance web solutions. 🚀 I'm experienced with a variety of JavaScript frameworks including Astro, Next.js, Remix, React, Qwik, Svelte, Preact, Lit, and Solid. 

I've created [qwik-sonner](https://github.com/diecodev/qwik-sonner) for handling notifications in Qwik apps and [qwik-date](https://github.com/diecodev/qwik-date) for managing dates in Qwik. 🌟

When I’m not coding, I’m either diving into new tech trends or just hanging out with friends. Always excited about the next big thing in tech! 😄

Feel free to drop me a line at [𝕏](https://twitter.com/diecodev)

If you like what I do, you can support me on [Polar](https://polar.sh/diecodev/). I'm also open for consulting or freelancing if you need help with web solutions. 🤝

Catch you around! 👋
