# Hi Linear team 👋

Most applications start with *“I'm excited to apply-”* - but I'll try something different:  
I actually deployed this cover letter on **Vercel**, because building things is how I think best.  

I'm **Diego Díaz**, a developer who loves:  

- squeezing every millisecond of performance ⚡  
- building tools that save dev time 🛠️  
- experimenting with frameworks just for fun 🧪  

Joining Linear feels like the natural next step in that obsession, a place where engineering craft and design quality actually matter.
