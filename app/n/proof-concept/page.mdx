## Understanding FOUC
FOUC, or Flash of Unstyled Content, occurs when a web page is rendered without the intended styles, leading to a poor user experience. This is particularly noticeable when implementing dark mode, as users may see a flash of light mode before the styles are applied. In this tutorial, we will explore how to implement a FOUC-free dark mode in a Next.js app using Tailwind CSS and cookies for state management.
