# Hi Vercel team 👋

Most applications start with *“I’m excited to apply…”* — but I’ll try something different:  
I actually deployed this cover letter on **Vercel**.  

I’m **Diego Díaz**, a developer who loves:  

- squeezing every millisecond of performance ⚡  
- building tools that save dev time 🛠️  
- experimenting with new frameworks just for fun 🧪  

Joining Vercel feels like the natural next step in that obsession.

**Best,**
